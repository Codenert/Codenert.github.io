      <h2 class="title">Core personal values</h2>
      <h3>How my culture has influenced my values and identity</h3>
  
      <p>Two of the many things I value, are time and hard work. My identity as an I-Kiribati person who migrated to New Zealand, has contributed how I value time and hard work. The lifestyle in Kiribati is easy and relaxing. We relied on the ocean and the land crop for food and we do not worry about other expenses like rent. Although we live a very relaxing life, we were taught to work hard especially when it comes to providing for the family. However, time was not an issue as there will always be plenty of time to do the work. It wasn’t until I moved to New Zealand, that I’ve realised that not only do we need to work hard to pay for rent, food and other expenses but also how time plays an important role in life.</p>
      <h3>How Others Sees Me</h3>
      <p>I asked my family about who am I am a person they know of. Here is what they sees me.</p>
      <p>Kateti identifies himself as an I-Kiribati, a person who is full Kiribati by blood and nationality. He is a family oriented and has key figures
          who have helped him to successful in his life. He has a strong work ethic and this is evident in how he works towards tasks. He is constantly
          wanting to solve problems related to projects and knows how to focus on the best answer or outcome not necessarily the easiet and fastest. 
          Kateti sees himself as a hard-worker who likes to help people. He is generous to a fault and seeks to bring solution to problems including eradicating
          and learning about things that are pertinent to the task at hand. By nature Kateti is a humble, creative, charismatic, logical and positive. He is 
          self-motivated to complete what is necessary to supply the demand specifically for jobs and projects.

      <h2 class="title">My strengths and limitations</h2>
      <p>Based on my research about myself, I found that I am a hard-working individual that loves to help and work with people.</p>
      <p>Hard work I think is very important towards my learning journey and career development. The fact that EDA uses flipped learning strategy so seeing hard work as one of my strength, it will help me to complete this course. Also, I am a person that likes to help and work with people and this will also be helpful since in this course we have to work in teams.
      <p>However, this course is very short, those strength will be meaningless if I dont put my time and effort.</p>
