        <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
        <h3>Long term goal</h3>
        <p>
            My main goal is to land a job as a software developer, I know there are different roles such as front end
            developer, back-end developer
            and fullstack developer. I would like to work anywhere in a tech company that offers these roles.
        </p>
        <h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>
        <p>After completing the foundation I know for sure that problem-solving skills is my strength. It is good to
            know that I have it because
            at the bootcamp I will use it for the techincal challenges. My limitation that I know for sure is
            communication and working with people.
            I will use whatever skills and techniques both from the foundation and the one I am going to learn at
            bootcamp to strengthen this area.
        </p>
        <h3>Non-technical challenge</h3>
        <p>
            The biggest non-techinical challenge for me at the bootcamp are communication with people, working people
            and I also have to admit that
            talking to big crowd of people is also my biggest challenge.
        </p>
        <h3>Human skills I would like to develop</h3>
        <p>
            I would like to develop and work on my limitations. I would like to see my communication skill and how I
            work with people improve. Most importantly, how I can train myself to be better around people so that I can
            fit in easily in any places such as workplace.
        </p>
        <h3>Expectations from the Bootcamp team</h3>
        <p>
            My expectation from the bootcamp team is high, the help and support throughout the bootcamp is what I need.
            I would like them to help me to be good in both problem-solving and human skills. I would like them also to
            help me with any techincal challenges and also see them as my guides throughout my learning journey at the
            bootcamp.
        </p>
        <h3>Expectations of myself on Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>
            I will utilize everything they provide at the bootcamp, the help and everything. If I do get stuck on the
            problem I will make sure that
            I will apply whatever I had learned at the foundation such as taking my break, giving myself time away from
            the computer and etc. To manage
            workload in the program, I will make that I apply the things that I values which are time and hard work. And
            also remembering that there are
            people there to help me such as fellow cohort or facilators so I have to consider that as well.
        </p>


        <h2>Foundation Learning Plan</h2>
        <h3>Long term goal </h3>
        <p>
            Programming, creating new things and problem-solving using codes are some of the things that I love and
            enjoy.
            My long-term goal is wanting to become a web developer, use tech to solve and create applications.
        </p>
        <h3>Human skills </h3>
        <p>
            The human skills I would like to develop while attending EDA are mainly my time management skills, improve
            my productivity,
            and working effectively with people. I understand that in this field, it is not all about writing codes and
            knowing everything.
            However, knowing to code is a good start but it is not enough to set my footstep in the tech industry.
            Working on these human skills will help me to achieve my long term goal.
        </p>
        <h3>My strengths and limitations</h3>
        <p>Based on my research about myself, I found that I am a hard-working individual that loves to help and work
            with people.</p>
        <p>Hard work I think is very important towards my learning journey and career development. The fact that EDA
            uses flipped learning strategy so seeing hard work as one of my strength, it will help me to complete this
            course. Also, I am a person that likes to help and work with people and this will also be helpful since in
            this course we have to work in teams.
        <p>However, this course is very short, those strength will be meaningless if I dont put my time and effort.</p>
        <h3>Commitment to manage my workload</h3>
        <p>To effectively manage my workload in this program, I will use what I've learned so far from the foundation.
            I will use the techniques I've learned such as timeboxing and the Pomodoro technique when working on my
            task.
            For every task that I will be given, I make sure I understand what are the learning competencies,
            I will set my time and do my research on those learning competencies for better understanding but more
            importantly is staying focus.
        </p>
        <p>
            When things are building up and starting to get overwhelming I will make sure that I stay focus, take a
            break when necessary. I will try to
            get back to it, this will make sure that I stay on track.
        </p>
        <h3>How and where will I seek help</h3>
        <p>Whenever I get stuck on a task I will try do it by myself first. This will help me to improve my problem
            skills as we are all know, a programmer
            is a person who can solve problem. I will try seek solutions online first, if I still dont get help then I
            will either seek help from my cohort or from one of the facilitators
        </p>
        <h3>Expect from the facilitation team</h3>
        <p>I see the facilitation team as my guides along this journey who I can rely on. They are there to provide
            feedback and help me whenever I stuck on task.

        </p>
        <h3>Scheduling information</h3>
        <p>I donâ€™t have any other commitments, but it is important that I schedule my time so that I can have time with
            my family and my time to play sports.
        </p>
