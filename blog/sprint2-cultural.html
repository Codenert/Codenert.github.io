        <h1 class=" title text-center">Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2 class="title">Long term goal </h2>
        <p>
            Programming, creating new things and problem-solving using codes are some of the things that I love and enjoy. 
            My long-term goal is wanting to become a web developer, use tech to solve and create applications.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Human skills </h2>
        <p>
            The human skills I would like to develop while attending EDA are mainly my time management skills, improve my productivity, 
            and working effectively with people. I understand that in this field, it is not all about writing codes and knowing everything. 
            However, knowing to code is a good start but it is not enough to set my footstep in the tech industry. 
            Working on these human skills will help me to achieve my long term goal.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">My strengths and limitations</h2>
        <p>Based on my research about myself, I found that I am a hard-working individual that loves to help and work with people.</p>
    <p>Hard work I think is very important towards my learning journey and career development. The fact that EDA uses flipped learning strategy so seeing hard work as one of my strength, it will help me to complete this course. Also, I am a person that likes to help and work with people and this will also be helpful since in this course we have to work in teams.
    <p>However, this course is very short, those strength will be meaningless if I dont put my time and effort.</p>
        <h2 class="title">Commitment to manage my workload</h2>
        <p>To effectively manage my workload in this program, I will use what I've learned so far from the foundation. 
            I will use the techniques I've learned such as timeboxing and the Pomodoro technique when working on my task. 
            For every task that I will be given, I make sure I understand what are the learning competencies, 
            I will set my time and do my research on those learning competencies for better understanding around more importantly staying focus.
        </p>
        <p>
            When things are building up and starting to get overwhelming I will make sure that I stay focus, take a break when necessary. I will try to 
            get to get back to it, this will make sure that I stay on track.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">How and where will I seek help</h2>
        <p>Whenever I get stuck on a task I will try do it by myself first. This will help me to improve my problem skills as we are all know, a programmer
            is a person who can solve problem. I will try seek solutions online first, if I still dont get help then I will either seek help from my cohort or from one of the facilitators
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Expect from the facilitation team</h2>
        <p>I see the facilitation team as my guides along this journey who I can rely on. They are there to provide feedback and help me whenever I stuck on task.

        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Scheduling information</h2>
        <p>I don’t have any other commitments, but it is important that I schedule in time so that I can have time with my families and my time to play sports.
        </p>
