        <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
        <p>
            One time when I was doing a challenge where I have to make the first letter of every word capitalized. The
            challenge is so simple, the sentence is to be passed to a function and the function should return a modified
            sentence with every first letter in every word capitalized. So the problem is so simple, I wrote my
            pseudocode as shown below
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Change the whole sentence to lower case</li>
            <li>Split the whole sentence by a space</li>
            <li>Go through every word</li>
            <li>Split each word</li>
            <li>Capitalize the first letter</li>
            <li>Join them back</li>
            <li>After going through every word in a sentence join them back and return the new sentence</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            That was the step I was following and then I ran the test and the test was giving me a fail. So I was
            surprised, I looked at my pseudocode I knew it correct. So I ran the test again and still fail so I started
            to output every word that I capitalized and surprisingly it did what I intended to do but the test result
            still gave me a fail message. At that moment, I stop what I was doing went outside, and gave myself a break.
            I went back on the problem again I carefully looked at every line in my code and I realized that I
            misunderstood the 'map' build-in function for the array.

        <p>
            What I learned from doing this challenge that it is so important to reflect on your code and really understand what each line of code is doing.
            Apply problem solving techniques as much as possible such as doing the pseudocode, taking breaks, rubber duck methods and etc because they really
            works. These solving problem techniques really helps to tackle problems and also helps to know where you are likely to make a mistake if do encounter 
            such problem.
