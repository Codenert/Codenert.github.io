        <h2>Mindset</h2>
        <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>Neuroplasticity exposes how the brain works and is designed to do, which is the ability of the brain to adapt
            to changes through a year of its lifetime.
            There are two types of neuroplasticity, functional and structural neuroplasticity. Functional
            neuroplasticity is the ability for the brain to replace
            connections internally this can help people to recover from different kinds of brain sicknesses such as
            traumatic brain injury, stroke, or other brain damage.
            Structural neuroplasticity is the ability to strengthen and create new connections based on
            experiences. This can be beneficial as well for
            people's abilities to learn new things or improve their skills in certain areas.</p>
        <p>
            By understanding the principle of neuroplastic can have a major impact on us throughout our learning journey
            in life. We should know that we are not born to be
            good at something or born with skills, but instead knowing that it is our job to fill and expand our brains
            by building and strengthed new connections.</p>

        <p>To learn new things, we just need to do it, it is our brain's job to build that connection in our brain. To
            be good at something, we just need to practice it. However, all of these will be meaningless unless we take
            good care of our brain properly that is by giving our brain time to rest such as having a good sleep every
            day. Exercising also has a benefit to our brain's health. </p>

        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>Growing Mindset is a way of thinking that an individual thinks positively toward challenges and also sees the
            challenges as opportunities to grow. Why this is relevant? Well, we all know that in our journey in life we
            always have to face challenges either in our personal life or at work. An understanding of a growth mindset
            can help us to overcome those challenges which helps us to reach our goal.</p>
        <p>Growing up until now I never knew about Growth and Fixed Mindset. As a young kid growing up I always do well
            in primary school, I always get a price for becoming 2nd sometimes 1st place in my class, and my friends
            always think that I am smart. I could not figure out why I'm smart the only thing that I have in my mind is
            that I got it from my mother thus I was born with it. However, in secondary school math was one of the
            subjects that I hated the most because I always failed my math test. As a result, I did not attend my math
            class. There was one time, before the final exam I realized that I have to pass my maths exam so that I can
            get into high school. The school policy in Kiribati is that for a student to get into high school they need
            to pass every subject. Anyway, I told myself that I have to attend my math class and believe that I can do
            it and it was surprising that after putting in my effort and believing that I can do it and when the exam
            came, I passed my math exam, and from then on maths became my favorite subject.</p>

        <p>The concept of Growth and Fixed mindset is something that I came across as a young kid during my time at
            secondary school and still fascinates me because I don't like math and now math became one of my favorite
            subjects. Based on my experienced and knowing that there are two types of mindset fixed and growth, I
            believe that I can grow and have the potential by putting in hard work, see challenges as
            opportunities and knowing that my abilities, talents and intelligence can be developed.

        <h3>How Growth Mindset and Neuroplasticity may shape or influence my learning</h3>
        <p>Learning is everywhere and it's something that will never stop no matter what place and at what age. Knowing
            that our brain changes and grows as we learn and that we can get better at a skill by trying, practicing,
            and persevering, so I think it is important that I understand how important neuroplasticity and a growth
            mindset to learning because this will help
            me succeed in my learning journey in life.</p>
