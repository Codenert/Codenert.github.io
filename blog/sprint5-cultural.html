        <h2>Core Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Wow, what a journey has been, facing and overcome different challenges, working both individually and
             in pairs, sharing ideas and thoughts, and putting myself out there to help others so I would say that
              it's been a great journey.
              Throughout this journey of learning, I found out the main three things I 
              learned about myself as a result of core learning, both my strength and limitation. I have both a 
              growth and fixed mindset, I also realized that I have low emotional intelligence and lastly I enjoy 
              challenges and have good problem-solving skills. Realizing these limitations I have for myself as a 
              human being I am grateful that core content taught me skills and techniques on how to improve on 
              these areas. I've learned that our brain is capable of building and strengthen new paths how this 
              can have a major benefit for a growth mindset. I've learned mindfulness, conscious listening, and 
              journaling and how they are so important to train my emotional intelligence. The framework and process 
              I learned have improved my problem-solving skills to the next level.
        </p>
        <h3>Role of values, empathy and self-awareness</h3>
        <p>
            Values, empathy, and self-awareness are very important in learning and programming. To understand the 
            roles of values, empathy and self-awareness I have to look back on how I applied it during the foundation. 
            As I mentioned in my sprint 1, I value time and hard work because we cannot achieve things if we don't
             put much time and hard work and this applies in both learning and programming. During the foundation, I was 
             able to put myself out there to help those who needed help. Instead of being quiet and focus more on me, 
             instead, I put myself in others situation, willingly to help them, embraced them when they managed to 
             solve their problems and that is empathy and self-awareness in my practice.
        </p>
        <h3>What surprises me</h3>
        <p>
            What surprises me about the core learning is how effective the skills and techniques are in both human 
            skills and problem-solving skills. However, from learning and applying it during the foundation has 
            helped to change me to better understand myself, how to work and communicate 
            effectively with people, how to use my time wisely, be able to give myself sometimes besides spending 
            my time on the screen.
        </p>
        <h3>What was challenging</h3>
        <p>
            The most challenging aspect of the core learning for me was applying emotional intelligence training. 
            I remembered when I have to do the conscious listening challenge, at first I was nervous and negative 
            thoughts came into my mind saying that I cannot do it. But then I overcame it when I remembered about 
            a growth mindset so I did it anyway and I was proud of myself because it became easy later on when I 
            did the pair programming challenge.
        </p>
        <h3>Why focusing more on a core learning</h3>
        <p>
            At Dev Academy, we spend most of our time on core learning even though we know it's a web developer school.
             There is a really good reason behind that because they want us to prepare ourselves for our future work in 
             the tech industry. In the tech industry, employers are looking for people with good human skills rather than 
             someone so knowledgeable in coding. Being a software developer is to be able to deliver  a message and share ideas and 
             thoughts with other people.
        </p>
        <p>
            So from my personal experience, I think it is not a waste of time studying the core learning because human skills 
            is very important in the workplace. Think about it, a company is a place where people from different cultures come 
            and work together. Being able to understand what you will bring will have a major impact on people 
            in the workplace. These techniques and skills that we learned are so important not just for the workplace 
            but for us to apply them during our learning journey at Dev Academy and possibly be able to apply them in 
            our long-term careers.
