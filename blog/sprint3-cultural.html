      <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
        <p>Emotional Intelligence, EQ, is the ability to recognize and manage our own and others' emotions. People with high EQ have good personal and social skills.</p>

        <h3>Personal Skills</h3>
        <p>Personal skills made up of three important elements self-awareness,  self-regulation, and motivation.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Self-Awareness</strong> - the ability to recognize our emotions and understand why our emotions occur</p> 
        <p><strong>Self-Regulation</strong> - the ability to control our own emotions when they occur at any given time at any given circumstance</p>
        <p><strong>Motivation</strong> - the ability to defer the temporary aspect and focus on the long term successes.</p> 
        
        <h3>Interpersonal Skills</h3>
        <p>Interpersonal skills are made up of two important elements empathy and social skills.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Empathy</strong> - is like self-awareness but instead about others feeling, the ability to aware about the needs and feelings of others.</p>
        <p><strong>Motivation</strong> - the ability to interact with other people easily and build a new connection easily with others</p>
        
        
        
        
        <h3>How Emotional Intelligence differ from Intelligence Quotient?</h3>
        <p>IQ indicates better cognitive abilities or the ability to learn and understand while EQ is the ability to recognize and manage our own and others' emotions. People are not born with EQ but an individual can obtain and improve by practicing it thus changes over time while IQ can be developed through school and sometimes at home.</p>
        
        <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
        <p>Based on my finding of Emotional Intelligence I think it is a very important skill to have especially if we want to pursue a career in professional environments. This world is full of people with different emotions and being able to adapt the skills
        we can easily manage and deal with people in our daily lives.</p>
