                    <p>Two of the many things I value, are time and hard work. My identity as an I-Kiribati person who
                        migrated
                        to New Zealand, has contributed how I value time and hard work.
                        The lifestyle in Kiribati is easy and relaxing. We relied on the ocean and the land crop for
                        food and we
                        do not worry about other expenses like rent.
                        Although we live a very relaxing life, we were taught to work hard especially when it comes to
                        providing
                        for the family. However, ...........<a href="sprint1-cultural.html">Read More</a></p>

                <p> Programming, creating new things and problem-solving using codes are some of the things that I love
                    and
                    enjoy.
                    My long-term goal is wanting to become a web developer, use tech to solve and create applications.
                </p>
                <p> Human skills I would like to develop while attending EDA are mainly my time management skills,
                    improve
                    my productivity,
                    and working effectively with people. I understand that in this field, it is not all about writing
                    codes
                    and knowing everything. ...........<a href="sprint2-cultural.html">Read More</a></p>

                    <h3>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h3>
                    <p>Neuroplasticity exposes how the brain works and is designed to do, which is the ability of the
                        brain to adapt
                        to changes through a year of its lifetime.
                        There are two types of neuroplasticity, functional and structural neuroplasticity. Functional
                        neuroplasticity is the ability for the brain to replace
                        connections internally this can help people to recover from different kinds of brain sicknesses
                        such as
                        traumatic brain injury, stroke, or other brain damage.
                        Structural neuroplasticity is the ability to strengthen and create new connections based on
                        experiences. This can be beneficial as well for...........<a href="sprint4-cultural.html">Read

                    <p>Wow, what a journey has been, facing and overcome different challenges, working both individually and
                        in pairs, sharing ideas and thoughts, and putting myself out there to help others so I would say that
                         it's been a great journey.
                         Throughout this journey of learning, I found out the main three things I 
                         learned about myself as a result of core learning, both my strength and limitation. I have both a 
                         growth and fixed mindset, I also realized that I have low emotional intelligence and lastly I enjoy 
                         challenges and have good problem-solving skills. Realizing these limitations I have for myself as a

                    <p>When talking about margin, border and padding being applied to an html element is best to think
                        of it
                        as
                        wrapping a gift. In this analogy, the gift or a present referred to as the content or html
                        element,
                        margin,
                        border and padding are
                        3 diffrent wrapping papers. The first layer represent the padding, second layer represent the
                        border
                        and

                        capitalized. The
                        challenge is so simple, the sentence is to be passed to a function and the function should
                        return a modified
                        sentence with every first letter in every word capitalized. So the problem is so simple, I wrote

                        pseudocode as shown below
